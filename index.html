I'm now at silverton.inrupt.net in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). So you see, in the long run, money always loses to love and authenticity. You can't buy originality, creativity, or authentic leadership." />

<!-- About my Fringe Interwebs Interstitial Art ... a message in a bottle //
The network, the web, it's surfaces, layers, protocols,
interactions with it's content and inhabitants, 
have been my tabla rasa, my canvas, my clay. 
Whatever is here, whatever I've wrought, 
is the only art and life I've known. 
Interpret and judge as you will. If you had lived the life I lived, 
you would have, by definition, done the same, exactly; 
just as would I have mirrored your every thought and action, were our fates exchanged. 
Multiply by 9 billion to approximate empathy for the world as we seem to know it. 
Perhaps my keen awareness of such fundamentals, 
juxtaposed by those living in utter denial of the same, 
were at the root of misunderstanding and resentment toward me 
in this flicker of time-space known as life on Earth. 
It was all my fault. It was all your fault. 
No one is without culpability or sin, some of us just admit that fact, 
which has always infuriated those blinded by arrogance and steeped in denial. // -->

  <p>As of <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps#IndieWebCamp_2011" target ="_blank">2010-2011</a>, the <a href="http://indiewebify.me" target ="_blank">indiewebs</a>, as digital <a href="http://commonstransition.org" target ="_blank">commons transition</a>; was perhaps our best and maybe only hope for a marginally compassionate global cognition and living space on our frail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank">Pale Blue Dot</a>.

<span class="p-note">To date, the best of humanity's collective scientific rigor, juxtaposed with the most ambitious intuitions and insights that have survived the relentless gauntlet of peer-reviewed deductive reasoning, seem to indicate that we do, in a sense, all live in a yellow submarine (<a href="http://youtu.be/krIus0i9xn8" target="_blank">Beatles</a>). That is, if said yellow submarine is considered analogous or archetypical of a holographic (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY" target="_blank">Susskind</a>) simulation (<a href="http://simulation-argument.com/" target="_blank">Bostrom</a>).

    <blockquote cite="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/08/20/james-baldwin-the-creative-process/">The artist is distinguished from all other responsible actors in society — the politicians, legislators, educators, and scientists—by the fact that he is his own test tube, his own laboratory, working according to very rigorous rules, however unstated these may be, and cannot allow any consideration to supersede his responsibility to reveal all that he can possibly discover concerning the mystery of the human being.<sup><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/08/20/james-baldwin-the-creative-process/" target="_blank">1</sup></a></sup>

    <p>And ... it's absolutely essential that you do it to the best of you ability. -- Ghandi; er, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428011839/http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Disputed" target ="_blank">maybe</a>.</p>
    <p>Because, however smart you or I think we are, from the current 21st century vantage point, the totality of humanity's collective intelligence is able to comprehend &mdash; now that the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson" target="_blank">Higgs boson</a> has rounded out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model" target="_blank">Standard Model</a> &mdash; less than 5% of WTF is. So, forgive me, you know, for ignoring criticisms of "utopia" and dismissing decrees of "just the way things are" ... however impressive or intimidating in origin. Ultimately, nobody knows the nature of our existential predicament any better than another. So all ideas do count. All dreams do have absolute material value. Without unfettered imagination, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile to implement, nothing meaningful to execute upon. Don't get caught up in one or the other, it takes both.</p>
