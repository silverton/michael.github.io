<!-- About my Odd Interstitial Art ... as if this will ever be read //
The network, the web, it's surfaces, layers, protocols,
interactions with it's content and inhabitants, 
have been my tabla rasa, my canvas, my clay. 
Whatever is here, whatever I've wrought, 
is the only art and life I've known. 
Interpret and judge as you will. If you had lived the life I lived, 
you would have, by definition, done the same, exactly; 
just as would I have mirrored your every thought and action, were our fates exchanged. 
Multiply by 9 billion to approximate empathy for the world as we seem to know it. 
Perhaps my keen awareness of such fundamentals, 
juxtaposed by those living in utter denial of the same, 
were at the root of misunderstanding and resentment toward me 
in this flicker of time-space known as life on Earth. 
It was all my fault. It was all your fault. 
No one is without culpability or sin, some of us just admit that fact, 
which has always infuriated those blinded by arrogance and steeped in denial. // -->
