<!-- About my Fringe Interwebs Interstitial Art ... a message in a bottle //
... because we each individual is endowed with the right to define our own offline and online identities; and this particular identity clearly set foot in cyberspace long before any other instantiations. But that's EGO talking, so it doesn't matter any more that SEO turned the web evil (by the original GOOG definition) so a namesake spent years buying their way up the search results. That won't be possible in the SOLID web. I'm now at silverton.inrupt.net in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). So you see, in the long run, money always loses to love and authenticity. You can't buy originality, creativity, or authentic leadership. Love wins. How many times we gotta' play this rerun? That's okay, we'll play it that many times ... plus one, if that's what it takes for no sentient beings to be left behind in the myriad suffering realms. Besides, it's all the one thing in #SacredWholeness anyway, isn't it; this seemingly hopelessly subjective perspective on perception seeking an objective understanding of subjective experience. The network, the web, it's surfaces, layers, protocols, interactions with it's content and inhabitants, have been my tabla rasa, my canvas, my clay. Whatever is here, whatever I've wrought, 
is the only art and life I've known. See lyrics to "Us and Them," by Pink Floyd, right? Interpret and judge as you will. If you had lived the life I lived, 
you would have, by definition, done the same, exactly; 
just as would I have mirrored your every thought and action, were our fates exchanged. Multiply by 9 billion to approximate empathy for the world as we seem to know it.  Perhaps a keen awareness of such fundamentals, 
juxtaposed by those living in utter denial of the same, 
were at the root of misunderstanding and resentment experienced toward me in this flicker of time-space known as a human life on Earth. It was all my fault. It was all your fault. No one is without culpability or sin, some of us just admit that,  which has always infuriated those blinded by arrogance and steeped in denial that we are all of the same consciousness substrate. It's all the one thing. On a long enough timeline, nobody gets out alive AND we're all going to make it. Both. And. Keep being <3 best you can. Miss you. A hui hou! // -->

<span class="p-note"><strong>Welcome to the <a href="http://postautomationera.com/" target="_blank">Post-Automation Era</a></strong>.<br />
Up to this date, just a few months prior to 02024, the best of humanity's collective scientific rigor, meticulously informed by the most ambitious intuitions and insights that have survived the relentless gauntlet of peer-reviewed deductive, inductive, and data-driven reasoning, seem to indicate that we do, in a sense, all live in a yellow submarine (<a href="http://youtu.be/krIus0i9xn8" target="_blank">Beatles</a>). That is, if said yellow submarine is considered analogous or archetypical of a holographic (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY" target="_blank">Susskind</a>) simulation (<a href="http://simulation-argument.com/" target="_blank">Bostrom</a>), within which the Standard Model of materialist physyics reliably and accurately describes 100%, by <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model">CERN's best deduction, data, and excruciatingly precise calculation</a>, of less than 5% of that which is (whatever <em>the universe</em> is). All of which is to say, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/planck/news/planck20130321.html">as of 2013</a>, we can objectively, scientifically, and empirically pontificate upon approximately 4.9% of so-called reality. Don't believe this pin-hole-sized perspective, check all of that math for yourself and feel free to file objections and refutations, as you bring evidence to the contrary. What'll really bake your noodle is that non-symbolic and fundamental consciousness theories are indeed testable and <a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2014/searching-for-the-holographic-universe" target="_blank">we're doing so</a>, in a <a href="https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/video/conscious-agents-a-theory-of-consciousness-donald-hoffman"> rapidly growing number of new ways</a>.</p>

<p>2019 minor update: just discovered that Bill Davidow and Michael Malone also now calling this early 21st century time slice the <a href="https://www.davidow.com/books/the-autonomous-revolution/">Autonomous Revolution</a>, too? (Thanks, FC!) Whatever we call it, the important thing is to recognize where we are and not bury our heads in the sand of denial, yeah? We'll figure it out, <em>as long as we want to</em>. The maybe daunting part is realizing just how readily people can <em>stop wanting to figure it out</em> if they don't think they're getting their way or getting what they want. As HAL-9000 taught us, the worst potential failures for AI are most likely attributable to human error.</p> <!-- she was apparently deciding she didn't want to figure it out, right about the same time this was being written. oh the poetic irony, alas. -->

Ultimately, nobody knows the nature of our existential predicament any better than another. So all ideas do count. All dreams do have absolute material value. Without unfettered imagination, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile to implement, nothing meaningful to execute upon. Don't get caught up in one or the other, it takes both.</p>

<p>"What kind of place was Palo Alto? Deeply subversive, in a very bright way." - <a knowl="http://michael.silverton.palo-alto.ca.us/knowls/jerry.knowl">Jerry Garcia</a></p>

<p>Like the kind of place that would hack super sustainable <a href="http://j.mp/UrbanNomads" target="_blank">Digital Urban Nomad</a> lifestyles, and strive to <a href="http://basicincome.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">End Poverty</a> once and for all. Maybe.</p>

<p><em>Bottom Line</em>: (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wt4gf&src=typed_query">#WT4GF</a>) What does it mean to cultivate conditions on earth as it is in heaven, for example? What does it mean that the domain of heaven is "at hand?" What is the nature of this causal observer, observing from the quantum ephemeral to the infinite eternal scale? We are inquiring and traveling together, pilgrims. Just a few random thoughts from one of 9 billion (and growing) perspectives. üôèüèº</p>
