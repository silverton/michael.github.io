But SEO turned the web evil, by the original GOOG definition, so a namesake spent years buying his way up the search results. LOL. Nice try, but that won't be possible in the SOLID web. I'm now at silverton.inrupt.net in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). So you see, in the long run, money always loses to love and authenticity. You can't buy originality, creativity, or authentic leadership." />

<!-- About my Fringe Interwebs Interstitial Art ... a message in a bottle //
It's all the one thing; this seemingly hopelessly subjective perspective on perception seeking an objective understanding of subjective experience. The network, the web, it's surfaces, layers, protocols,
interactions with it's content and inhabitants, 
have been my tabla rasa, my canvas, my clay. 
Whatever is here, whatever I've wrought, 
is the only art and life I've known. 
Interpret and judge as you will. If you had lived the life I lived, 
you would have, by definition, done the same, exactly; 
just as would I have mirrored your every thought and action, were our fates exchanged. 
Multiply by 9 billion to approximate empathy for the world as we seem to know it. 
Perhaps a keen awareness of such fundamentals, 
juxtaposed by those living in utter denial of the same, 
were at the root of misunderstanding and resentment experienced toward me 
in this flicker of time-space known as a human life on Earth. 
It was all my fault. It was all your fault. 
No one is without culpability or sin, some of us just admit that, 
which has always infuriated those blinded by arrogance and steeped in denial
that we are all the same. It's all the one thing. // -->

<p>ETH is LOVE: ðŸ’– 0x1eb2d6E3f26fBBF31B485bbe3e316D6dAd806632</p>

<span class="p-note"><strong>Welcome to the <a href="http://postautomationera.com/" target="_blank">Post-Automation Era</a></strong>. To date, the best of humanity's collective scientific rigor, juxtaposed with the most ambitious intuitions and insights that have survived the relentless gauntlet of peer-reviewed deductive reasoning, seem to indicate that we do, in a sense, all live in a yellow submarine (<a href="http://youtu.be/krIus0i9xn8" target="_blank">Beatles</a>). That is, if said yellow submarine is considered analogous or archetypical of a holographic (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY" target="_blank">Susskind</a>) simulation (<a href="http://simulation-argument.com/" target="_blank">Bostrom</a>), within which the Standard Model of materialist physyics reliably and accurately describes <em>100% of less than 5% of that which, by deduction, is</em>. What'll really bake your noodle is that non-symbolic and fundamental consciousness theories are indeed testable and <a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2014/searching-for-the-holographic-universe" target="_blank">we're doing so</a>. Just discovered that Bill Davidow is also now calling this early 21st century time slice the <a href="https://www.davidow.com/books/the-autonomous-revolution/">Autonomous Revolution</a>, too. (Thanks, FC!) Whatever we call it, the important thing is to recognize where we are and not bury our heads in the sand of denial, yeah? We'll figure it out, as long as we <em>want to</em> ... together.</span>

      "According to the Planck mission team, and based on the standard model of cosmology, the total mass â€” energy of the universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy. Currently, no proposed Theory of Everything has been widely accepted or verified.

    <p>And ... it's absolutely essential that you do it to the best of you ability. -- Ghandi; er, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428011839/http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Disputed" target ="_blank">maybe</a>.</p>
    <p>Because, however smart you or I think we are, from the current 21st century vantage point, the totality of humanity's collective intelligence is able to comprehend &mdash; now that the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson" target="_blank">Higgs boson</a> has rounded out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model" target="_blank">Standard Model</a> &mdash; less than 5% of WTF is. So, forgive me, you know, for ignoring criticisms of "utopia" and dismissing decrees of "just the way things are" ... however impressive or intimidating in origin. Ultimately, nobody knows the nature of our existential predicament any better than another. So all ideas do count. All dreams do have absolute material value. Without unfettered imagination, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile to implement, nothing meaningful to execute upon. Don't get caught up in one or the other, it takes both.</p>
