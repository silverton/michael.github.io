  <p>2021-2022: encouraged to find a supremely pragmatic and down-to-earth fellow explorer echo his own unique articulation of a shared lifelong inquiry toward <a href="https://youtu.be/hJ_6CEpDLic?t=14m40s">an objective understanding of subjective experience</a>. That was fun, although <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/probably-nothing-why-people-still-hate-crypto/">probably nothing</a>.</p>
  <p>2020-2021: ftp, only hindsight has any chance of reviewing what happened here with some sense of independent perspective gained with the passage of linear time.</p>
  <p>June 2021: an unexpectedly emotional tribute to professor John McCarthy and all the engineers who <a href="https://youtu.be/46CMCKMmS_E">made the dream real</a> at Waymo. My pitch to the company: "Yaymo with Waymo!" Need to make the experience much lighter and less intimidating. Many people are still sincerely kind of freaked out by AVs. The <a href="https://postautomationera.com/">Post-Automation Era</a> scares many people and I believe it is our duty to validate that, not dismiss it; address and alleviate suffering, responsibly and compassionately.</p>
  <p>2018-2019: played around creating Library of Congress compliant <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2018912670">pen name and qualified independent publishing label</a> mostly while backpacking Hawai ªi nei. Wrote and published <a href="https://amzn.to/2URmAjL">this book</a>(with obligatory <a href="https://j.mp/WhereWeGoFromHereFREE">free and open access version</a>). First draft mostly written with voice to text on a solar-powered Pixel 2XL between camp sites.
  <p>2017-2018: it appears <a href="https://timbl.inrupt.net" target="_blank">timbl</a> and <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" target="_blank">others</a> have had enough, as <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com/about" target="_blank">solid</a> was born. I'm at <a href="https://silverton.inrupt.net/profile/card#me">silverton.inrupt.net</a>, for now, and may migrate this domain to solid, for fun.</p>
  <p>2012-2017: the <a href="https://www.godownsize.com/become-full-time-rver/">great downsizing</a> at <a href="https://calledtowander.com/full-time-rving-guide/">full-time RV</a> academy.
  <p><a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps#IndieWebCamp_2011" target ="_blank">2010-2011</a>: the <a href="http://indiewebify.me" target ="_blank">indiewebs</a>, as digital <a href="http://commonstransition.org" target ="_blank">commons transition</a>; perhaps our best and maybe only hope for a marginally compassionate global cognition and living space on our frail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank">Pale Blue Dot</a>, as some weird Global Brain Id appears to have hijacked our emergent (originally free, open, public) collaborative cognition space.</p>
