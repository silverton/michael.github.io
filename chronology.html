  <p><strong>02025</strong> <em>(absurd foresight written 15Sep02023)</em>: end of the first quarter of the century where AI more-or-less awakened, even if not yet sentient. now what, genius futurists? maybe better to focus on universal childhood safety and welfare, and the end of <em>all forms of human exploitation</em>; physical, emotional, psychological, social, and the technological amplification of all of them. maybe begin acknowledging the lack of informed consent in contexts of vastly adverse and inequitable abilities to even become informed, much less, consent. open all university archival history of all human subject experimentation. all of it. forget about aliens for a minute, what have <em>we done to one another</em> in the name of reverse-engineering our own direct experience? nevermind punitive measures for those who were just playing a supersized version of the infamous <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe" target="_blank">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>. it's not about retribution. it's about understanding so that maybe we can let the healing begin. remember, if i survive, i'll now have 65 years experience on the planet being told i'm "far-fetched," and "imagining things," only to have seen a good 80% to 90% of those things come to fruition. this isn't anything special. it's very basic. very human. it's called intuition. insight. you have it. you know you have it. just because you can't pull it out of your backpack and show it off doesn't mean it doesn't exist. as was the case with all the hate directed at those of us with inconvenient insights by those who didn't want to be seen at the time. they "suffer" convenient shameless amnesia. they "suffer" drug-hazed and money-crazed excesses and excuses. it was what it was. is what it is. que será, será, as it ever will be, worlds without end. maybe you'll be among the ones to change everything for the better.
  <p><strong>02022-02024</strong>: the end of the world as we knew it. also, back to the beginning of the complete unknown, apparently. today, all that <a href="" target="_blank">stuff about consciousness</a> that seemed obvious to the <a href="#desert-rat">Desert Rat</a> and for which he was labled crazy, is becoming more and more scientifically verifiable/falsifiable. see <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mathematics+of+conscious+realism&ia=web" target="_blank">mathematics of conscious realism</a>. <!-- none of that matters though, because the all-powerful <em>they</em> say it all balances out in the end, so <em>this is the time for that</em>, right? <em>this present moment is that end</em> of the <a href="https://youtu.be/884VNMgJxpA" target="_blank">long run</a> &ndash; from the perspective of where we began &ndash; so where else we gonna' go when everywhere we go, there we are with all the same old, same old? lyric: <em>did you do it for love? did you do it for money? did you do it for spite? did you think you had to, honey?</em>. seems we already done found out, didn't we? you're there doing that and i'm here doing this. that's the reality we've co-created both. and. the end. oh well. you always said i needed to not care, but i did and always will and that's the difference between you and me, love. --></p>
  <p><strong>02021-02022</strong>: encouraged to find this supremely pragmatic and down-to-earth fellow explorer echo his own unique articulation of a shared lifelong inquiry toward <a href="https://youtu.be/hJ_6CEpDLic?t=14m40s">an objective understanding of subjective experience</a>. That was fun, although <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/probably-nothing-why-people-still-hate-crypto/">still probably nothing</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>02020-02021</strong>: ftp, only hindsight has any chance of reviewing what happened here with some sense of independent perspective gained with the passage of linear time.</p>
  <p><strong>June 02021</strong>: an unexpectedly emotional tribute to professor John McCarthy and all the engineers who <a href="https://youtu.be/46CMCKMmS_E">made the dream real</a> at Waymo. My pitch to the company: "Yaymo with Waymo!" Need to make the experience much lighter and less intimidating. Many people are still sincerely kind of freaked out by AVs. The <a href="https://postautomationera.com/">Post-Automation Era</a> scares many people and I believe it is our duty to validate that, not dismiss it; address and alleviate suffering, responsibly and compassionately.</p>
  <p><strong>02018-02019</strong>: played around creating Library of Congress compliant <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2018912670">pen name and qualified independent publishing label</a> mostly while backpacking Hawaiʻi nei. Wrote and published <a href="https://amzn.to/2URmAjL">this book</a>(with obligatory <a href="https://j.mp/WhereWeGoFromHereFREE">free and open access version</a> [which seems to have sadly expired? will look into it]). First draft mostly written with voice to text on a solar-powered Pixel 2XL between camp sites. Used Hawaiian pen name because of the literal physical damage incurred by haters of this idea in my hyper-conservative extended family circles. So also 1960-1975, below; except maybe more like psychological and social engineering edition. This book's thesis <em>is after all</em>, the essential reason MLK was assassinated. It was fine when we were pitting the people against each other by race and creed, but uniting them for economic integrity? That was a bridge too far on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Hotel, which I've since been insanely privileged to visit. Oh, and I also was so dumbfounded and in an otherworldly feeling state that I neither sat down nor kneeled as I ought to have, where he did, while visiting <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/13/us/martin-luther-king-jr-jefferson-county-jail-preserves-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">this cell</a> where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_from_Birmingham_Jail" target="_blank">Letter from Birmingham City Jail</a> was penned.
  <p><strong>02017-02018</strong>: it appears <a href="https://timbl.inrupt.net" target="_blank">timbl</a> and <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" target="_blank">others</a> have had enough, as <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com/about" target="_blank">solid</a> was born. I'm at <a href="https://silverton.inrupt.net/profile/card#me">silverton.inrupt.net</a>, for now, and may migrate this domain to solid, for fun.</p>
  <p><strong>02012-02017</strong>: the <a href="https://www.godownsize.com/become-full-time-rver/">great downsizing</a> at <a href="https://calledtowander.com/full-time-rving-guide/">full-time RV</a> academy.
  <p><a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps#IndieWebCamp_2011" target ="_blank">2010-2011</a>: the <a href="http://indiewebify.me" target ="_blank">indiewebs</a>, as digital <a href="http://commonstransition.org" target ="_blank">commons transition</a>; perhaps our best and maybe only hope for a marginally compassionate global cognition and living space on our frail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank">Pale Blue Dot</a>, as some weird Global Brain Id appears to have hijacked our emergent (originally free, open, public) collaborative cognition space.</p>
    <p><strong>02002-02012</strong>: Enjoyed a season of incredible privilege, doing my unwitting best to put privilege to work for the benefit of others. Details later.</p>
	<p><strong>01992-02002</strong>: Becoming "that other guy" <a href="https://youtu.be/JBvc7Ny4iUk?si=zehqllqUSAkxGs_5" target="_blank">as Kevin Smith puts it</a>. Did it. Got the fiber-optic street cred, t-shirts, stickers, and experiences. Easy to mock in retrospect; height of childhood trauma-driven over-compensation in another. Nobody wants to hear the painful experiences of those who <em>appear</em> so privileged. We are in some ways, in others, not so much. Kevin <a href="https://youtu.be/JBvc7Ny4iUk?si=zehqllqUSAkxGs_5" target="_blank">explains the process</a> pretty well.</p>
	<p><strong>01981-01991</strong>: Army National Guard. Three years active, three reserve. OR Tech then Mech Infantry platoon leader. Still lost in the part. Trying to "become" something or somebody. For who? For what? We'll find out in the next episode.</p>
	<p id="desert-rat"><strong>01975-01981</strong>: Desert Rat Dayz. Phoenix. White Punks on Dope. Not particularly proud of that. Very proud of construction jobs and working in the sandia fields of South Phoenix pueblo. Was what it was. Didn't realize I could have learned Spanish right there and then. Lost in the part. More later.</p>
	<p><strong>01959-01975:</strong> Gestation. Birth. School. Work. Death. In our first episode, the kid gets nothing less than straight A's, ever. Teacher's pet. Boy Scout. Smart. Confused. Clueless. Not quite Angela's Ashes, but my own insignificant personal vers. Didn't know how much the regular beatings with belts, coat hangers, shoes, sandles, wooden spoons, whatever wasn't bolted down at home would kinda define the rest of the movie.
