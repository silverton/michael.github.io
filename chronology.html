<h1>on observing the observer observing the observed?</h1>
<small>
sounds absurd. an entirely subjective attempt at impartial partial observations of whatever just happened (lived experience)? along with occassional interstitial glimpses of just how counterproductive and destructive the misuse of abusive <a href="https://metavalent.com/" target="_blank">default consensus reality</a> narratives can be within any tribe, community, island, or society. one way to quickly get away from what might be perceived as this site's bias toward naïve optimism is by making an eight second comprehensive final judgement about a random annotated human life on the internet and <a href="https://hmpg.net/" target="_top">moving on</a>. no worries. it's all good. no harm no foul. good vibes only. <a href="http://endoftheinternet.com/" target="_top">até mais! aloha means a adiós, auf wiedersehen, goodbye!</a> amo você! sinto sua falta! nunca mais volte! <!-- everyone has a right to c0eXiSt, right? (just not on *your* island). love is love, while we HATE you for being so "out of line" according to the self-appointed island line keepers. it's the covert/overt hatred though, while outwardly hearing the words "i love you," while in the same breath, "your safety is of no concern to me." do they not see the crazy, or do they use it as unthinkable psychological weaponry? according to dr.'s ramani darvasala and sam vaknin, it's a little of both. question is, what is to be *done* about such gruesome people, if anything? Maybe this https://metavalent.com/2021/04/17/09-06-40-Toxic-Online.html -->

<!-- Maybe this: Male or female, maybe especially female because it's become acceptable and trainable as a bogus "strong, independent woman" trait, while it's still widely presumed that this criminal mindset is a "male" trait ... narcissism is extremely non-binary ... "People with a narcissistic personality disorder are “criminals” even if they do not ever get arrested. Their “sense of entitlement” and “unreasonable expectations” result in injury to others. They manipulate and exploit people in their unceasing efforts to build themselves up. Their “contemptuous” and “impatient” behavior has a negative impact on others. The people who suffer the most are those closest to them. Spouses, children (while an impeccable image can be cultivated at work). In order to peacefully coexist, everyone must try to satisfy the narcissist's insatiable psychological needs. A person who does not meet the expectations of the narcissist likely will have a very unpleasant encounter." https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inside-the-criminal-mind/202002/the-narcissist-criminal -->

<p id="fn1_return">oh, yikes, after that<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></em>, you <em>still</em> stayed to further dissect or exhume a random, <a href="https://youtu.be/C_xGUbMFRMw?si=hl1Mv8XFFZTbieu2" target="_blank">narcissistic</a>, blathering, cringy auto-bio on the internet? okay, you're choice. you were warned. LOL.</p> <!-- she must really be feeling especially bored and vindictive today, or just seeking more ammunition to pierce closer to the kernel of the soul's source code, yeah? --> 

<p>my life's thesis question, from about age 12 was, "how do we achieve an objective understanding of subjective experience?" even sitting in a 7th grade physics lab, it was obvious that my "scientific observations" were subjective. strings. rulers. springs. toy cars sliding across a table top. lumps of playdough dropped from the ceiling and timed with a stopwatch. hilarious. fun. we then compared our individual subjective observations to the reported subjective observations of others. i didn't have that precise language at age 12, but walking home from school, observing the leaves on the trees at O'Neil Park dancing in the flowing arcs and paths of the algebraic and calculus graphs i'd been shown, it was clear that mathematics and physics were the languages of the material motion of things.</p>

<p>later that same summer, i found a dead bird in the attic of the house and realized, "oh, that's going to happen to me." so, returning to the 7th grade playground pronouncing, "you know, however long this life seems to us, even if we live to 80, and no matter what we do, it'll all seem to have flashed by in the blink of an eye." blank stares. fear. disbelief. mistrust. aggression. pretty much the same response from most humans, ever since.</p>

<p>alas, spending a decade in one's teens and 20's self-medicating with alcohol, weed, and LSD didn't seem to <a href="https://youtu.be/x-xTttimcNk?t=2m45s" target="_blank">ease the pain</a> of knowing that one just doesn't fit in, and so forgetfulness can set in, a modicum (or mayhem) of conformity-based-approval-seeking can follow, and hence this brief abstract of fortunate and unfortunate events.</p>

<p>wait. stop. try not to label "good or bad" like that. stuff happened and will continue to happen, according to conditions. but wait, labels help to clarify, assess, process, and understand, right? so nevermind. how can we be both fully <a href="https://youtu.be/yesXC_ibRKE?si=OZhZHdP8np_EfuLB" target="_blank">accountable and shameless-blameless</a> for our lives at the same time? we can't. shame a blame must be engaged. digested. it's the only way. the only way "it all evens out in the end," <!-- (as someone who just stole say, $30,000 from you [by ingeniously dark triadic indirect means such as encouraging increasing social isolation then evicting you, with zero social-support recourse] or maybe $3,300,000 [in the form of implicit complicity with your haters for 30 years] ... is apt to suggest) --> is to even it out in the now; to quit future faking ourselves and others that tomorrow is somehow promised. that we somehow have a sure plan, if everyone would only conform to <em>our</em> wishes.</p>

<p>to stop accepting that justice is only for others, at our expense, so we must shut up and obey because our day will be later, or the accusation that we "already had our day" and we somehow didn't deserve it, so now we must pay. because some self-appointed imperious <em>we</em>, ornately adorned with "coexist" bumper stickers and "be kind" t-shirts declares that YOU are voted off the island. why? because <em>we</em> don't like you exposing our ugliness and hypocrisy to ourselves. how <em>dare</em> you. maybe all of the above is as false as some fairytale afterlife in which "it all evens out." regardless, these are some of the distorted dialogs that we find populating the nascent collective global brain, today. ancient, angry, brutish stuff, to be sure.</p>

<p>is it really possible <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/8rMfYzsqURw" target="_blank">to end it</a>, let alone <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/lbFBdhYE2cU" target="_blank">directly and immediately</a>?</p>

<p>seems like <a href="https://metavalent.com/metavalent/2023/04/29/19-11-31-Fiduciary-Duty.html" target="_blank">we can do better</a>, if we want to. we each choose this day whom and what values we will serve.</p>

<p>also seems like <strong>inescapable eternity is in this very moment</strong>, every moment, by definition. in that case, there's no past or future in terms of doing the right thing and being the most ethical version of ourselves, today. no lying. no deceiving. no coercing. no social engineering for fun, greed, or psychopathic pleasure. <!-- no hating, harming, and eviscerating those who choose not to wear a "love is love" or "be kind" t-shirt with matching coffee mug and "coexist" bumper sticker. yeah, love is love, and that hate is hate. --> as the song goes, "it's so simple and so complicated at the verrrrrrrrrry same time."</p>

  <p id="fn2_return"><strong>YEAR</strong>: some stuff that happened.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></em></p>
  <p><strong>02024-02025</strong>: <em>(foresight, 15Sep02023): end of the first quarter of the century, where AI more-or-less awakened, in a rudimetary way that revealed just how easy it is for humans to believe that machines are intelligent, based on super impressive brute-force computing at scale. so now what, new generations of fellow grandiose optimistic futurists? maybe it's better to finally focus on universal childhood safety and welfare <!-- which didn't happen for either of us, and hence all this pathology -->, and the end of <em>all forms of human exploitation</em>; physical, emotional, psychological, social, and the technological amplification of all of them. maybe begin acknowledging the lack of informed consent in contexts of vastly adverse and inequitable abilities to even become informed, much less, consent. open all university archival history of all human subject experimentation. all of it. forget about aliens for a minute, what have <em>we done to one another</em> in the name of reverse-engineering our own direct experience? nevermind punitive measures for those who were playing a supersized version of the infamous <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe" target="_blank">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>, it's not about retribution, it's about understanding; so that maybe we can let the healing begin. if i survive to the date of this forecast, or if i'm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary" target="_blank">unable update this again</a>, i'll have reached 65 years experience on the planet, being told i'm often and generally far too "far-fetched" and "imagining things," only to have seen a good 80% to 90% of such things come to fruition <!-- including her lifetime of bullshit to which i apparently remained willfully blind, in service to various missions to improve technology and financial incentives in order to end poverty, primarily -->. this isn't anything special. it's very basic. very human. <em>it's called intuition. insight. you have it. you know you have it. believe and trust that.</em> just because you can't pull intuition or insight out of your backpack and show it off doesn't mean they doesn't exist. as was the case with observations of all the hate directed at those humans throughout history who expressed inconvenient insights in their time &mdash; the same is likely to happen to you, truth-seeking futurist, short of emergency interventions in the lowest rungs of human nature. then, as now, the sufferers suffer from conditions such as conveniently shameless amnesia; so they are able to do all manner of harm with complete intentially amnesiac impugnity. above all, such sufferers desire that you too suffer, that your optimism be crushed, hopes annhilated, and will demoralized. if they can't get you to self-destruct, they will self-destruct into drug-hazed and money-crazed excesses and excuses and blame you for their self-destruction. remember, the truth of a corrupt community or society is not the community or society, it's <em>the truth-revealer's fault for pointing out the dysfunctions</em>. tale as old as time, like the Emperor's New Clothes, played out a trillion-trillion-trillion idiotic times by a different trillion idiots and handful of truth-seers and speakers. it was what it was. is what it is. que será, será, as it ever will be, worlds without end. sounds morose? it's only so you can know this: despite the odds, if you so choose, YOU CAN and WILL be among the ones to change all of this for the better. nothing heroic, particularly, just your light nature shining in all that darkness.
  <p id="des_rat"><strong>02022-02023</strong>: the end of the world as we knew it. <!-- aka, 222 means being told FU, I don't care if you get beaten to a pulp by vicious drug thugs, by the person closest to you whom you actually never really knew, even after 30+ years, after she gets fed 70% concentrated THC vape by "friends" at "work" where I directly witnessed extremely shady cash-under-the table payments to teenagers for "help on the trail" at the Rooster Ranch --> also, back to the beginning of the complete unknown, apparently. today, all that <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mathematics+of+conscious+realism&ia=web" target="_blank">stuff about consciousness</a> that seemed obvious to the <a href="#desert-rat">Desert Rat</a> and for which he was labeled crazy, is becoming more and more scientifically verifiable/falsifiable. see <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mathematics+of+conscious+realism&ia=web" target="_blank">mathematics of conscious realism</a>. oh, but <a href="https://youtu.be/eVF4kebiks4?si=YuRnhTP5FBSob-Eq&t=33" target="_blank">what's really going to bake your noodle later on</a> is how tiny islands <!-- not Kauaʻi, of course --> can and do effectively operate as <a href="https://youtu.be/wT1GzRmR1rk?si=4IXuiGlBjf6Y-F8Z" target="_blank">cults</a> that effectively destroy all stable long-term pair-bonded relationships in the name of unbounded "freedom" from that level of emotional and psychological sobriety, trust, loyalty, and stability. do not believe the writer. just the facts, ma'am. go observe and conduct the longitudinal studies for yourself. <!-- none of that matters though, because the all-powerful <em>they</em> say it all balances out in the end, so <em>this is the time for that</em>, right? <em>this present moment is that end</em> of the <a href="https://youtu.be/884VNMgJxpA" target="_blank">long run</a> &ndash; from the perspective of where we began &ndash; so where else we gonna' go when everywhere we go, there we are with all the same old, same old good, bad, ugly, and beautiful? key lyric: <em>did you do it for love? did you do it for money? did you do it for spite? did you think you had to, honey?</em>. seems we already done found out, didn't we? you're there doing that and i'm here doing this. that's the reality we've apparently co-created. both. and. the end. oh well. you always said i needed to not care, but i did care and always will care and that's the difference between you and me, my tragically lost love. --></p>
  <p><strong>02021-02022</strong>: encouraged to find this supremely pragmatic and down-to-earth fellow explorer echo his own unique articulation of a shared lifelong inquiry toward <a href="https://youtu.be/hJ_6CEpDLic?t=14m40s">an objective understanding of subjective experience</a>. That was fun, although <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/probably-nothing-why-people-still-hate-crypto/">still probably nothing</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>02020-02021</strong>: ftp, only hindsight has any chance of reviewing what happened here with some sense of independent perspective gained with the passage of linear time.</p>
  <p><strong>June 02021</strong>: an unexpectedly emotional tribute to professor John McCarthy and all the engineers who <a href="https://youtu.be/46CMCKMmS_E">made the dream real</a> at Waymo. My pitch to the company: "Yaymo with Waymo!" wasn't too well received, LOL. Need to make the experience much lighter and less intimidating. Many people are still sincerely kind of freaked out by AVs. The <a href="https://postautomationera.com/">Post-Automation Era</a> scares many people and I believe it is our duty to validate that, not dismiss it; address and alleviate suffering, responsibly and compassionately.</p>
  <p><strong>02018-02019</strong>: played around creating Library of Congress compliant <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2018912670">pen name and qualified independent publishing label</a> mostly while backpacking Hawaiʻi nei. Finally wrote and published <a href="https://amzn.to/2URmAjL">The Book</a>(with obligatory <a href="https://j.mp/WhereWeGoFromHereFREE">free and open access version</a> [which seems to have sadly expired? will look into it]). First draft mostly written with voice to text on a solar-powered Pixel 2XL between camp sites. Used Hawaiian pen name because of the literal physical damage incurred by haters of this idea in my hyper-conservative extended family circles. So also 1960-1975, below; except maybe more like psychological and social engineering edition. This book's thesis <em>is after all</em>, the essential reason MLK was assassinated. It was fine when we were pitting the people against each other by race and creed, but uniting them for economic integrity? That was a bridge too far on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Hotel, which I've since been insanely privileged to visit. Oh, and I also was so dumbfounded and in an otherworldly feeling state that I neither sat down nor kneeled as I ought to have, where he did, while visiting <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/13/us/martin-luther-king-jr-jefferson-county-jail-preserves-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">this cell</a> where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_from_Birmingham_Jail" target="_blank">Letter from Birmingham City Jail</a> was penned.
  <p><strong>02017-02018</strong>: it appears <a href="https://timbl.inrupt.net" target="_blank">timbl</a> and <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" target="_blank">others</a> have had enough, as <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com/about" target="_blank">solid</a> was born. I'm at <a href="https://silverton.inrupt.net/profile/card#me">silverton.inrupt.net</a>, for now, and may migrate this domain to solid, for fun.</p>
  <p><strong>02012-02017</strong>: the <a href="https://www.godownsize.com/become-full-time-rver/">great downsizing</a> at <a href="https://calledtowander.com/full-time-rving-guide/">full-time RV</a> academy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180829042952/https://www.patreon.com/turtletrekkin" target="_blank">TurtleTrekkin.com</a>. <!-- Proof of how the best of intentions can lead straight off a cliff; or in my case, to a <em>Shitty Little Paradise&trade;</em> (next book in progress) called the island of Kauaʻi, which seems to be in competition for world capital of narcissistic, dissociative, self-righteous, self-indulgent, me-me-me-me-me land. Where aloha means, "we will destroy your life, take your wife, and GTFO because there is apparently no greater HATRED than the world's most hypocritical Love-is-Love Kindness Cult." -->
  <p><a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps#IndieWebCamp_2011" target ="_blank">2010-2011</a>: the <a href="http://indiewebify.me" target ="_blank">indiewebs</a>, as digital <a href="http://commonstransition.org" target ="_blank">commons transition</a>; perhaps our best and maybe only hope for a marginally compassionate global cognition and living space on our frail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank">Pale Blue Dot</a>, as some weird Global Brain Id appears to have hijacked our emergent (originally free, open, public) collaborative cognition space.</p>
    <p><strong>02002-02012</strong>: Enjoyed a season of incredible privilege, doing my unwitting best to put privilege to work for the benefit of others. Details later.</p>
	<p><strong>01992-02002</strong>: Becoming "that other guy" <a href="https://youtu.be/JBvc7Ny4iUk?si=zehqllqUSAkxGs_5" target="_blank">as Kevin Smith puts it</a>. Did it. Got the fiber-optic street cred, t-shirts, stickers, and experiences. Easy to mock in retrospect; height of childhood trauma-driven over-compensation in another. Nobody wants to hear the painful experiences of those who <em>appear</em> so privileged. We are in some ways, in others, not so much. Kevin <a href="https://youtu.be/JBvc7Ny4iUk?si=zehqllqUSAkxGs_5" target="_blank">explains the process</a> pretty well.</p>
	<p><strong>01981-01991</strong>: Army National Guard. Three years active, three reserve. OR Tech then Mech Infantry platoon leader. Still lost in the part. Trying to "become" something or somebody. For who? For what? We'll find out in the next episode.</p>
	<p id="desert-rat"><strong>01975-01981</strong>: Desert Rat Dayz <a href="#des_rat">&uarr;</a>. Phoenix. White Punks on Dope. Not particularly proud of that. Very proud of construction jobs and working in the sandia fields of South Phoenix pueblo. Was what it was. Didn't realize I could have learned Spanish right there and then. Lost in the part. More later.</p>
	<p><strong>01959-01975</strong>: Gestation. Birth. School. Work. Death. In our first episode, the kid gets nothing less than straight A's, ever. Teacher's pet. Boy Scout. Smart. Confused. Clueless. Not quite Angela's Ashes, but my own insignificant personal vers. Didn't know how much the regular beatings with belts, coat hangers, shoes, sandles, wooden spoons, whatever wasn't bolted down at home would kinda define the rest of the movie.
