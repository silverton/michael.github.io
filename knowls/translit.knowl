<p>Introducing the knowl: better browsing on the Web</p>
<p>The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) is pleased to introduce a new tool to the world of web pages - the knowl. Like the familiar hyperlink, knowls can be used to provide relevant, supplementary information and are referenced from within the body of a web page. But unlike the hyperlink, which simply takes you to a new web page, <strong>the knowl conveniently serves up the information at your original location with the click of a mouse button. With a similar click, the knowl then disappears</strong>.</p>
<p>"The self-contained nature of knowls makes them useful in many different settings. They can be thought of as 'building blocks' that can be called upon when needed. I envision a time when the Internet has a repository of such knowls, reliable and ready to be referenced anywhere." says David Farmer, Director of Programs at AIM.</p>
<p>Knowls were developed to support research projects in advanced mathematics, but they can be easily incorporated to enhance any website. Knowls creator Harald Schilly noted, "The technology for knowls is at least 10 years old, and the theoretical basis, known as <a knowl="knowls/transclusion.knowl">transclusion</a>, is more than 50 years old. Our contribution is to provide an interface that fits the way people browse the Web today." </p>
